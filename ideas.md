# MOTIVATION

-Information can help decision making, but given reference-dependence, some people will choose to avoid information when they not expect it to avoid realizing negative outcomes (bad cake). This insight can inform incentive design, for example, in medical testing, set up the expectation to receive the information. Not that useful for situations when consumption resolve uncertainty, ours is a (first, not really, KR09 too, bad theirs comes from the content of the news) test in which the role of assignment/ownership/status quo beyond expectations can't play a role! (which explains why such a large effect)

- fix cite style in footnote 19 about what a realization is (estimation strategy)

# PLOTT & ZEILER (2005,2007)

*** COMMENT ON THIS (from cerulli-harms, see also foonote 6)

Our design eliminates important potential confounds outlined in the critiques of Plott and Zeiler (2005, 2007)
and Ericson and Fuster (2011) for subjects inferring some specific value from their endowment. First, subjects are
randomized to being buyers or sellers. Hence, if an object will be taken away from one person with a specified
probability, it will be given to someone else, limiting subjectsâ€™ ability to make value inferences about the objects in
question. Second, subjects are forced to consider the alternative object even if they hope to keep their endowment
because, with a fixed probability, the alternative object will be theirs.


# Is multiple hypothesis testing an issue?

  > twitter answer to MHT
	I think that relates to testing multiple simultaneous hypotheses within a model. To me, the chart raises issues more related to model selection.

	> A useful paper on this: http://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf

	> One could also do Bayesian model averaging.
	Good point. Ideally, all models should be estimated simultaneously, you cannot just evaluate whether CI's overlap if they are estimated on overlapping samples.. Should be possible in a giant, stacked regression, I guess. Nonetheless, pointwise CI's seem to be standard reporting.''

# THINK ABOUT THIS

We say that GIVEN that they decided to eat the cake, those who expect to receive it value the information more than those who don't expect it. How to think about whether the expectation to receive it affect the choice to go to begin with. This feels similar to KR's examples about the rational expectations with the shoes and the prices. Gotta think more about it.
