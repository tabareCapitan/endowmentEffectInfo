# INTRODUCTION

## Current structure

1.  Ana and Beto...
2.  Parallel with endowment effect for risk
3.  Information != risk
4.  Models of expectations-based reference dependent preferences predict it
5.  Intro to lab experiment...
6.  Some control over heterogeneity of expectations
7.  Key experimental manipulation
8.  Results of low baseline
9.  Introduction to explore whether the effect is reduced by experience
10. KR’s rationalization of List’s applied to our case
11. Results of high baseline
12. Policy implications: Information policies are everywhere
13. Welfare evaluation of these policies is hard because value can be negative
14. Endowment effect info complicates evaluation. Depends on expectations
15. New policy tool to reduce information avoidance
16. Sort of roadmap

## To-Do

- Relate to information preferences literature
- Re-write the current policy implications

---

# THEORY

- Either add proofs of drop wording "Proposition"
- Pretty sure propositions should be "For any 'positive' lottery"

---

# EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE

- Finish and post supplementary online material

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

- Beautify figure "Structure of the experiment"


## RESULTS

### ESTIMATION STRATEGY

- Be more explicit about why I make such a big fuss with the estimation if it is a simple experiment. Need to start a paragraph with something like "experimental data is often simply estimated with an OLS.... while these guarantees unbiasedness..."
  - Be specific about why balance tables should not be included with good cites from statistics journals
-

### RESULTS USING CHOICE DATA

- Write size of the effect in terms of percentage points
- Make sure the number of regressions is correct and percentages above or below thresholds too
- Add notes below figures to explain them
- Beautify main graphs
  - Consider using Stata 16 to include both graphs in one, but using transparency. Might be more confusing at first, but also easier to see that the endowment effect is reduced


### RESULTS USING WTA DATA

- Footnote 24 promises alternative results using alternative assumptions for the open intervals of the MPL. Need to include that.
- Add notes below figures to explain them
- Beautify main graphs
  - Consider using Stata 16 to include both graphs in one, but using transparency. Might be more confusing at first, but also easier to see that the endowment effect is reduced

# SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

- Revise it all
- Follow Bellemare's advice for conclusion
- About unsatisfactory "need to be more careful with welfare analysis"
  - wtp vs wta dicussion akin to which referent should be used

---

# APPENDIX

- add caption to tables such as descriptive statistics
- Add WTA robustness results for the Supplementary material
- fix citations in appendix "large differences"
- change title of graphs in application to identify large differences

# TALK AND INTERVIEWS

- Answer to: "where did you get the idea for the job market paper?"


# WAY LATER

- Use https://acarril.github.io/posts/export-results-latex to avoid hard-coding any result
- (?) add some on external validity (List, 2020?)
- Fix code
  - add to new programs code
  	ssc install svmatf, replace
  	dependency: net install dm79.pkg
- randomization inference confidence intervals?
  - https://github.com/simonheb/ritest/blob/master/README.md#cis
  - at least add the distribution of coefficients
- Complete github ReadMe
  - qsf files
  - recruitment flyer to supplementary material
