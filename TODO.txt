BIG PICTURE TODO LIST ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Based on your rev file, complete the intro and conclusion based on yours and Linda's feedback. I'm not touching the other sections until you are done with your edits.

2. Small changes to ensure the analysis is, at least, compliant with AEA replication standards.

3. Making Latex tables instead of the current excel ones.

4. Preparing the Latex file without the text (i.e., figures, tables, appendices, bibtex).

5. Finishing appendices, including the texdoc description of data manipulation (in which I have now changed the treatment of outliers to the one you originally had).
