twitter answer to MHT
I think that relates to testing multiple simultaneous hypotheses within a model. To me, the chart raises issues more related to model selection.

A useful paper on this: http://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf

One could also do Bayesian model averaging.

Good point. Ideally, all models should be estimated simultaneously, you cannot just evaluate whether CI's overlap if they are estimated on overlapping samples.. Should be possible in a giant, stacked regression, I guess. Nonetheless, pointwise CI's seem to be standard reporting.

check if in the ref dep paper I confuse pp for %!!!!

- plan what to answer for the question: "where did you get the idea for the job market paper?"
- add caption to tables such as descriptive statistics (what is a 3.4 without the likert scale)
// ssc install svmatf, replace
 // dependency: net install dm79.pkg
- section 4. results should be a subsection of section 3 (experimental evidence)
- add recruitment flyer to supplementary material
