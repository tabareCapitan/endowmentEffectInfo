- Is multiple hypothesis testing an issue:
	twitter answer to MHT
	I think that relates to testing multiple simultaneous hypotheses within a model. To me, the chart raises issues more related to model selection.

	A useful paper on this: http://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf

	One could also do Bayesian model averaging.

	Good point. Ideally, all models should be estimated simultaneously, you cannot just evaluate whether CI's overlap if they are estimated on overlapping samples.. Should be possible in a giant, stacked regression, I guess. Nonetheless, pointwise CI's seem to be standard reporting.
