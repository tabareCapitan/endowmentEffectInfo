\noindent
We show, both theoretically and empirically, that an endowment effect for information arises from the expectation of getting information. Furthermore, we show that this endowment effect matters to welfare analysis of information policies, and can be put to advantage in situations where widespread dissemination of information is socially desirable (e.g., benefits of using masks during the COVID-19 global pandemic).
